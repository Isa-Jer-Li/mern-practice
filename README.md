# Project-Practice

---

This is a simple project to help students practice the 
entire MERN stack.

The application makes an API call to https://ip-api.com/
on the frontend to get the current location of the user. 
Then, another API call is made to the backend of 
the application to insert the user's data into a 
MongoDB database.
